# **CityInfoAPI - ASP.NET Core 8**

## **Project Overview**

CityInfoAPI is a RESTful API built using C# and ASP.NET Core 8 to manage a cities info. The API follows the MVC approach, implementing CRUD operations (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) with concepts such as route groups, input validation, extension methods, data transfer objects (DTO), dependency injection, singleton pattern, securing and documenting the API, testing and deploying the API.

The project utilizes SQL Server with ASP.NET configuration and .NET Secret Manager to securely connect the API to the database. Entity Framework Core is employed as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to facilitate querying and modifying the database using C# language. Additionally, the asynchronous programming model is adopted to enhance API performance and scalability.

## **Module 1: Getting Acquainted with ASP.NET Core**

In this first module, we learned about the basics. We started with a big picture. ASP.NET Core is a cross platform, high performance, open‑source framework for building modern, cloud‑enabled internet‑connected apps. Initially, ASP.NET Core ran on the .NET Core platform .NET Core was later renamed to .NET, and version four was skipped to avoid confusion with the existing older full .NET framework, which was also on version 4.x. At the moment of recording, we are at ASP.NET Core 8, running on .NET 8. After having learned about that, we created our first ASP.NET Core web application. We learned that the Program class is the starting point of our application, or to be more exact, the main method of that class. We don't see that method, but the compiler generates it behind the scenes. It's that generated main method that is responsible for configuring and running the application. In our case, we'll be running a web application and that needs to be hosted. For that, a web application builder can be used. The Services collection on that builder is what we can add services to while configuring them. This is the built‑in dependency injection container. So, by adding services to it, we can inject them wherever we need them in our code. Once all services have been registered and configured, the web application can be built. This results in an object of type WebApplication, which implements IApplicationBuilder. Instances of classes implementing this interface provides mechanisms to configure an application's request pipeline. By doing so, we specify how an ASP.NET Core application will respond to individual HTTP requests. The components that potentially handle these requests are called middleware, which can potentially be scoped to different environments. And with that, the basics are covered. In the next module, we will dive into creating our API and returning data.

## **Module 2: Creating the API and Returning Resources**

We started by clarifying the MVC pattern, Model View Controller. The Model handles the logic for our application data. The View represents the parts that display data. In case of an API, that's the data typically in JSON format returned from API calls. And the Controller handles the interaction between the View and the Model. This pattern leads to more reuse and better testability. Then we learned that we should use the GET method when we want to return data from our API. It's routing that takes care of mapping a request URI to a method on our controller. Next to GET, there's also POST for creating, PUT for updates, PATCH for partial updates, and DELETE for delete. For APIs, attribute‑based routing is advised over convention‑based routing. We also learned about content negotiation. This is the process of selecting the best representation for a given response. Formatters take care of serialization, and it's the media type that is set as the Accept header value that drives this. For returning a file, the ControllerBase method File can be used. Important is to set the correct media type on the response to ensure that the operating system knows the correct Viewer to use. And with that, this module is done. But we're currently just returning data from our controllers. Most APIs also require the ability to manipulate data. Let's check that out in the next module.
